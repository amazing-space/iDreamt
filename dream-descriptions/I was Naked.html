            Being naked in a public place suggests that you are struggling to find yourself or that you feel that you are being wrongly accused or exposed. If you are not the naked person in the dream but you see a nude person and are sickened by it, it may mean you are worried about exposing that person over a particular issue. It could also mean that you are comfortable in your skin. Also with who you and other people are because you understand that everyone is different.
